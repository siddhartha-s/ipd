In these notes, single-semicolon (;) comments are comments that should be
written in code that you write as well. They are a necessary part of the
design of the program. Comments written with two or more semicolons, or
in the form of this comment, are meta-comments explaining what the notes
are about, and would not be included in an actual program that you would
write.

#|
Choices of strategy:

  Structural decomposition:

    Using a template to inspect a class of data.

  Interval decomposition:

    Discriminating a numeric value based on intervals.

  Decision tree:

    Choosing between alternatives based on a sequence of questions.
    (Note that functional/structural decomposition are specific kinds
     of decision trees.)

  Function composition:

    Combining other functions to produce some result.

  Domain knowledge:

    Translating non-programming knowledge into code.

Note that interval is a specific kind ofdecision trees. And structral
decomposition has an element that looks very much like a decision tree.
And domain knowledge may even take the form of function composition or
a decision tree. However, we should write down the strategy that actually
informs our design, which is usually the most specific strategy that applies.
If both ways of thinking about the function seem helpful, use both (except
if you use structural decomposition, then you should not combine it with
another one; use a helper function instead).
|#

#|
Making a template for an enumeration or itemization:

  I. Create a cond clause for each alternative in the D.D.
  II. Add a question to each clause to distinguish it.

During coding, multiple clauses with the same answer may be collapsed.

;; Part 2: adding structure
;;
;; Suppose that in addition to the radius of the circle, we want
;; to keep track of the number of times it has grown, as a kind of
;; score. This means we need to keep track of two values:
;;
;;  - the radius, and
;;  - the score.
;;
;; But we only get one world value. How can we do it? By defining a
;; new class of data that represents *composite* values, that is, values
;; composed of multiple other values that can be projected out.


;; [this is a structure data definition:]

; A CGWorld is (make-cgw Radius Number)
(define-struct cgw (radius score))
; interp. `radius` is the radius of the circle and `score`
; is the count of successful clicks

#|
The previous data definition creates four functions:

 - A *constructor*, make-cgw : Radius Number -> CGWorld
 - A *predicate*, cgw? : Any -> Boolean
 - Two *selectors*:
    - cgw-radius : CGWorld -> Radius
    - cgw-score : CGWorld -> Score

To do structural decomposition of a structure, we take an *inventory*
of available *selector expressions*:
