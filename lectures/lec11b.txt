Implementing Union-Find
-----------------------

Union-Find ADT

  - new_uf : Nat -> UnionFind
    Creates a new disjoint set structure for the given number of
    vertices.

  - union! : UnionFind Nat Nat -> Void
    Joins together the sets containing the given vertices.

  - same_set? : UnionFind Nat Nat -> Bool
    Determines whether two vertices are in the same set.

How might we implement this efficiently? We’re going to pursue a set of
approaches the consider each disjoint set to have some distinguished
“ID” element that is chosen arbitrarily from its elements. Then we add
an operation:

  - find : UnionFind Nat -> Nat
    For any vertex, gives back its ID element.

Then

    def same_set?(uf: UnionFind?, u: nat?, v: nat?) -> bool?:
        find(uf, u) == find(uf, v)

How might we implement these efficiently?

Solution 1: Eager (quick find)

Keep a vector of size |V|, where each element gives the set number of
the corresponding vertex, where the set number is the number of an
arbitrary vertex in the set. So find is easy. How about union!? (O(V).
How?)

This is too slow: O(VE) for |E| unions on |V| objects.

Solution 2: Lazy (quick union!)

Keep a vector `id` of size |V| representing a parent-pointer forest of
vertices. That is, this forest (representing two disjoint sets)

      0         5
    / | \       |
    2 3 6       1
        |
        4

would be represented with this array:

  id = (vector 0 5 0 0 6 5 0)

Each root lists itself, and each non-root lists its parent.

The ID of any vertex v is given by the fixpoint of id:

  id[id[ ... id[v] ... ]] until it stops changing

(V[M] is syntactic sugar for (vector-ref V M).)

To union u and v, set id[(find u)] to be id[(find v)].

         5
       /   \
      0    1
    / | \
    2 3 6
        |
        4

Problem: trees can get tall, so find is expensive; and need to do find
to do union!, so union! is expensive too.

Solution 3: Weighting (weighted quick union)

To the previous solution add a second vector that keeps track of the
size of each tree. Initialize it to all 1s, and then whenever you
union!, link the smaller tree below the larger one, updating the larger
one’s weight.


   (w = 5)   (w = 2)

      0         5
    / | \       |
    2 3 6       1
        |
        4

      0
   / / \ \
   2 3 6 5
       | |
       4 1

This will tend to make trees wider rather than taller. How much? Depth
is at most lg V. (How can we prove this?) So find is O(log V), and
Kruskal’s algorithm is O(E log E).

But we can do slightly better...

Solution 4: Path compression (WQUPC)

Whenever you find the root of a vertex, update id for all vertices along
the path just traversed to point directly to the vertex. This takes no
longer (asymptotically) than just doing the find, but it prevents having
to retraverse the path again in the future. This keeps the tree almost
completely flat, and result in amortized O(log* V) time for each
operation.

SUMMARY

Time for |E| operations on |V| vertices:

  Quick find     O(EV)
  Quick union!   O(EV)
  Weighted QU    O(V + E log V)
  WQUPC          O((V + E) log* V)

Note that log* is nearly constant.

(Some sources claim α [inverse Ackermann] instead of log*.)
