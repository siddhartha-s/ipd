BANKER’S QUEUE
--------------

Previously we saw two ISL representations of a queue (FIFO):

  - The forward list representation, where the head is the first element
    of a list.

  - The backward list representation, where the head is the last element
    of a list.

We saw that for the former, enqueuing is a linear time operation,
whereas for the latter, dequeuing takes linear time in the number of
elements in the queue.

Can we do better?

(One way to do better is to use *mutation*, which we’re saving for
later.)

  - The banker’s queue representation, in which we keep a pair of lists,
    `front` and `back`, where the queue in order (like forward list
    representation) is (append front (reverse back)).

IOW, the head of the queue is either the first of `front`, or if `front`
is empty, the last of `back`.

Let’s implement the queue ADT operations for the banker’s queue
representation.

  (define-struct bq [front back])

  (define empty-bq (make-bq '() '()))

  (define (empty-queue q)
    (and (empty? (bq-front q)) (empty? (bq-back q))))

  (define (enqueue q x)
    (make-bq (bq-front q) (cons x (bq-back q))))

  (define (dequeue q)
    (cond
      [(cons? (bq-front q))
       (make-bq (rest (bq-front q)) (bq-back q))]
      [else
       (make-bq (rest (reverse (bq-back q))) '())]))
;; Why not
;;     (make-bq '() (reverse (rest (reverse (bq-back q)))))
;; ?

  (define (get-head q)
    (cond
      [(cons? (bq-front q))
       (first (bq-front q))]
      [else
       (first (reverse (bq-last q)))]))

What’s the time complexity of our queue operations?

Well, `enqueue` just does a cons and make-bq, each of which is O(1), so
`enqueue` is O(1). But both `dequeue` and `get-head` occasionally have
to reverse a list, making them O((bq-back q)).

For our analysis, we make two assumptions:

  - The queue is treated linearly, in the sense that we never look at
    old versions of it. Every time we change it with a queue operation,
    we use that new queue going forward.

  - We always use `get-head` and `dequeue` in tandem. That is, when we
    observe the head of the queue, we also discard it from the queue.

(Are these realistic assumptions? Consider graph BFS.)

Then we can show that while some individual queue operations are linear
time, any sequence of k queue operations is just O(k), not O(k^2). This
is because each list node, by the linearity condition, is subject to
reversal at most twice (once for get-head and once for dequeue). In k
steps we can enqueue at most k element, which means we can take at most
2k reversal steps.
