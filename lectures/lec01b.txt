This Course
-----------

This course is about the fundamentals of
programming (and computation):

  - from specification to implementation
  - software engineering principles
  - (a little bit of computation)

This course is *not* about:

  - Racket, or any other language: Java, C, C++, Python, etc etc
      We have to pick a language, or else
      this is just talk. We picked a teaching language
      inspired by Racket, but it *not* Racket.

  - Programming tools (DrRacket, gcc, gdb, javac, etc etc)
      Again, we need something, so we
      picked DrRacket, but it is designed
      to stay out of the way, as much as possible.

  - Specific libraries or protocols (http, XML, Gtk, etc)
      We might see glimpses of these in exercises,
      but only as they help you understand those points
      above

  - How programs get translated to digital signals
      Programming digital computers, or programming
      with genes in test tubes -- it doesn't matter.
      We don't study the details of that; we study
      how to contruct and maintain the programs
      themselves.

Arithmetic, Algebra, and Computation
------------------------------------

Arithmetic is computing.

What are do these equal:

  2 + 3 = 5
  4 x 2 = 8
  cos(0) = 1

No one said:

  2 + 3 = 1 + 4

or

  2 + 3 = 1 + 1 + 3

even though those are valid, right?

There is a direction to those equalities, complex to
simple.

So, we are simplifying those expressions, until nothing is
left to do. We know how to simplify them based on the basic
rules of arithmetic.

*that*'s what computation is about, from an algebraic
perspective. Simplification of expressions.

How about this one:

   (2 + 3) x 5
 = 5 x 5
 = 25

simplify complex expressions by finding embedded simple
ones to simplify. How about this one:

   2 + 3 x 5
 = 2 + 15
 = 17

precedence helps us find the next to simplify.

How about definitions:

  f(x) = x * (x+1)

now we can use that defined function in expressions:

   f(2)
 = 2 * (2+1)
 = 2 * 3
 = 6


Let's talk notation:

  - sometimes operators go in the middle: +, *
  - sometimes operators go in front: cos.
  - sometimes parens indicate grouping: 1 * (2+3)
  - sometimes parens are used for arguments: cos(0)
  - sometimes parens are optional: 1+(2*3)
  - sometimes not: (1+2)*3
  - sometimes = means a definition: f(x) = x * x + 1
  - sometimes = means a simplification step: 1 + 2 = 3

YUCK!

  - when we get to full blown computation, this just gets
    incredibly unwieldy (and gets in our way, see above)


Lets use a simpler notation:

  - all operators go at the beginning followed by the arguments
  - all operations begin with a paren and end with a paren.
  - never add any extra parens.

  1 + 2   -->   (+ 1 2)
  4 + 2 * 3  -->  (+ 4 (* 2 3))
  cos(0) + 1  -->  (+ (cos 0) 1)

Let's simplify definitions in the same manner. We'll use a
new keyword: define

  f(x) = x * (x + 1)

  (define (f x) (* x (+ x 1)))

  paren, define, "function call skeleton", body, paren

Now, this `f' becomes a new operator and we use our new
syntax rules just as before:

   f(2)  --->  (f 2)
   f(1+3) -->  (f (+ 1 3))

evaluation with the new notation is just like before (but
with the new notation, of course):

   (f (+ 1 3))
 = (f 4)
 = (* 4 (+ 4 1))
 = (* 4 5)
 = 20

Numbers are not the only kinds of values! What about
booleans:

  1 < 2 = true
  (< 1 2) = #true

  1 > 2 = false
  (> 1 2) = #false

  2 >= 2 = true
  (>= 2 2) = #true

anyone care to guess about and and or? not?

    (not (= 1 2))
  = (not false)
  = true

We also have strings:

  "apple"

  "pear"

  (string=? "apple" "pear") = false
  (string=? "pear" "pear") = true

  (string-append "apple" " or " "pear") = "apple or pear"

DrRacket also supports *images* as values. You will see this
on your homework. Here's a taste, from the blackboard:

  (rectangle 35 35 "solid" "black")
  =
  ... a solid box ...

  (circle 25 "outline" "white")
  =
  ... an outline circle ...

what about combining images?

  (overlay (rectangle 25 25 "solid" "white")
           (circle 35 "outline" "black"))
  = (overlay .. a solid box ...
             (solid-box 35 35 "black"))
  = (overlay ... ...) ;; draw pictures on board
  = ...

How about a function?

  (define (anonymize i)
    (overlay
     (circle (image-width i) "solid" "blue")
     i))

What does that do?

  (anonymize ...me...)
  =
  ... me with dot ...

The stepper.

DrRacket will actually show you all these steps
automatically, like we've been doing manually.

Put everything in the definitions window, click <step> and
watch it go.

As a note: to define a constant image, do this:

  (define me ...)

  Special | Insert image ...

to put it right there. Then, `me' will refer to that image
in the rest of your program.

Programming
------------

That was computation. What about programming?

Where did anonymize come from? Did God smile down on us and
voila out it comes from our fingers?

 - programming requires creativity.

Programming requires creativity, there's no doubt. But there
is structure and based on that we've got guidance about how
to build programs. Design rules can guide and focus
creativity.

 - just like music

this is analgous to music: you need scales, rhythm, (and
even, gasp) counterpoint (if for no other reason than to
know how to move *past* it, in that case)

 - so far: just notation.

What we've seen so far is merely the notation. But we need
more than just notation to get beautiful music.

 - need design recipes

So, we have a design recipe. As the course goes on, we'll
build upon the simple recipe that we've started with today.

Design recipe overview:

  - Data
  - Signature, purpose, header
  - Examples
  - Body
  - tests (run the examples)

data: what does the function consume and produce?
   numbers,
   booleans,
   images,
   strings

Signature, purpose, and header:

 ; f2c : Number -> Number
 ; to determine a Celsius temp from a Fahrenheit one
 (define (f2c f) ...)

 ; is-milk? : String -> Boolean
 ; determines if `s' is "milk":
 (define (is-milk? s) ...)

Examples:

 sample inputs and outputs that ensure you know what you're
 doing. *before* you write the function:

 (f2c 32) should be 0
 (f2c 212) should be 100
 (f2c -40) should be -40

 (is-milk? "oj") should be #false
 (is-milk? "milk") should be #false

Body:

  This is where the creativity comes in. How do you get
  from the inputs to the outputs?

  (define (f2c f)
    (* 9/5 (- f 32)))
  (define (is-milk? s)
    (string=? s "milk"))

Tests:

  If you're clever, you just write your examples below the
  function definition in the format above and all you need
  to do now is click execute in DrRacket and check that
  your examples come out right. But sometimes there will be
  clearer ways to write your examples that won't work as
  tests.

Importance of the Design Recipe:

   The design recipe is *the* critical thing I hope you
   will take away from this course.

   It is *not* Racket-specific.

   Yes, it is simple now, but if you don't get in the habit
   now, you'll fail later, when it gets harder.

   Accordingly, if there's no design recipe visible in your
   homework, it won't get a good grade.
