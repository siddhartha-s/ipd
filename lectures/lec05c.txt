AVL trees
============================================================

Before the break, we found that if we had a tree that with the binary
search tree invariant, we could search directly for the person we
wanted in the tree.

But the tree might still have a bad shape (like we talked about
before):

  /\
   /\
    /\
     /\
      /\
       /\
        /\


where, in the worst case (deciding to go right) only eliminates a
single node in the tree.

So now we want to study is a form of tree that, in addition to keeping
the numbers arranged in the tree, also guarantees that the tree
remains (mostly) balanced.

What is the best possible case? Well, at each level in the tree, we
look at one number and that means that 1/2 of the nodes are
eliminated. What does that kind of tree look like?

        /\
       /  \
      /    \
     /      \
    /\      /\
   /  \    /  \
  /\  /\  /\  /\ 

How does the height compare to the size of these trees? That is, if we
have a tree of height N, how many nodes are in there? 2^N, right? So
that means that if we have a tree of N nodes, what is the running time
of looking up a node in it? log(N). That's fast.

We're not going to get something that's always that good, but we're
going to see if we can get something that's still very good. Here's
the precise definition:

Here is the data definition for an AVL tree:

;; an AVL-tree is either:
;;  (make-node number AVL-tree AVL-tree number)
;;  "leaf"
;; INVARIANT :
;;   the BST invariant, PLUS
;;   (<= -1 (- (height left) (height right)) 1)
(define-struct node (value left right height))

The height of the tree is distance to the furthest "leaf" and the
invariant ensures that the heights of the left and right subtrees of
any tree stay ... close enough.

Is close enough good enough?

Well, if they are equal, then we're okay and we'll get good trees, so
that's good. But what is the worst case? We can't have a tree like the
one above, right? But we could have one where every left-hand node was
one bigger than every right node, all over the tree. What do those
trees look like?

 << see lec05-worst-case.pdf >>

In general, if the left-hand node's depth is one more than the right
one, then we have a situation like this:

  S(1) = 1
  S(2) = 2
  S(n) = S(n-1) + S(n-2) + 1

Okay, math happens here, cf the Fibonacci numbers. But even in this
case, we get that the height of the tree is proportional to the log of
the number of elements in it. In this worst case.

Lets make some example trees.

Since we are going to store the heights in the trees, then it is
useful to have a helper function that computes those heights for us
(see build-db and height in lec05-avl.rkt).

(define size1 (build-db 2 "leaf" "leaf"))
(define size2l (build-db 3 size1 "leaf"))
(define size2r (build-db 1 "leaf" size1))
(define size3
  (build-db 4
            (build-db 2 "leaf" "leaf")
            (build-db 6 "leaf" "leaf")))

Okay, so this is all fine: if we have this invariant, we can exploit
it. But how do we get it?

Well, as it turns out, it is possible to write a function like this:

   insert : AVL-tree number -> AVL-tree

in such a way that it guarantees the AVL invariant.

Lets do it!

The critical piece to keep in mind as you work though the code is that
you can rotate a tree. This rotation can adjust the heights in a
helpful way and it does not affect the BST invariant:

      y             x
     / \           / \
    x   C    ==>  A   y
   / \               / \
  A   B             B   C

Think of the 'x' and 'y' as numbers in the tree and the 'A' 'B' and
'C' as entire trees. if the tree on the left has the BST invariant, so
does the one on the right. And vice versa.

The basic strategy is to do an insertion at the bottom of the tree and
then, since that (possibly) increases the height, do a bunch of
rotations in order to restore the AVL tree invariant.

Lets try to write the code and work though those invariants.

[[ see lec05-avl.rkt for the completed code ]]

Here's a challenge for you: you do not need to keep the entire heights
in the tree. It is sufficient to keep only one of three possible
states: "left" (meaning the left tree is one taller than the right),
"right" (meaning the right tree is one taller than the left), and
"even", meaning that the two trees have the same height.

You cannot implement the function insert with that contract, but if
you change it so that it returns both the new tree and a boolean
indicating if the new tree got taller, then it is possible to
implement.
