Arbitrarily large data
----------------------

Lets turn to an aquarium. And, lets say that the only thing
we care about for fish is their weight.

... draw 2 fish ...

How can we represent these two fish?

;; an aq is:
;;  - (make-aq number number)
(define-struct aq (first second))

Generic template:
;; func-for-aq : aq -> ...
(define (func-for-aq aq)
  ... (aq-first aq) ...
  ... (aq-second aq) ...)

;; aq-weight : aq -> number
(define (aq-weight aq)
  (+ (aq-first aq)
     (aq-second aq)))

;; etc etc

... uh oh -- one of the fishes died!

What happens to our data?

Now, we have
;; an aq is
;;  - (make-aq number)
(define-struct aq (first))

What happens when the data definition changes?
  the template changes.
What happens when the template changes?
  the functions all change.

Generic template:
;; func-for-aq : aq -> ...
(define (func-for-aq aq)
  ... (aq-first aq) ...)

;; aq-weight : aq -> number
(define (aq-weight aq)
  (aq-first aq))

and so on for *all* of the functions! (yuck)

So, we go buy a replacement fish and we see two
beautiful ones in the store...

;; an aq is:
;; - (make-aq number number number)
(define-struct aq (first second third))

oh no, not again!

Our data isn't working.

An aquarium isn't 1, or 2, or 100 fish -- it should allow
us to have whatever number we want.

We need a *list* of numbers.

There is nothing new in the language for this -- we just
need to *think*.

Structs as Boxes
----------------

define-struct makes up a new kind of box.

(define-struct hms (hr min sec))
  ==> box with 3 compartments

(define-struct frozen (timer displayed))
  ==> box with 2 compartments

The compartments each hold only 1 thing:

  hms box: 
   +------------------+
   | 11  |  25  | 30  |
   +------------------+

but they stretch to fit big things:

  frozen box

  +----------------------------------------------------+
  |                          |                         |
  |   +------------------+   |   +------------------+  |
  |   | 11  |  25  | 30  |   |   | 10  |  45  | 00  |  |
  |   +------------------+   |   +------------------+  |
  |                          |                         |
  +----------------------------------------------------+

Still, only a fixed number of slots.

Lets say you want to pack up 4 fishes. You have 2 slot
boxes. How can you do it?

Well, you can put them into two boxes.

But that's not good enough -- you must also put the two
boxes into their own box!

How about 8?

16?

So, we can double the number of fish each time, but what
about just adding one? How can we do that?

For no fish, we use '(), pronounced "empty".

Then, we put together one fish in a box with '().

Then, we put together one more fish in a box with the
previous stuff.

Lets turn this back into a define-struct:

 (define-struct bigger-box (weight box))

 (make-bigger-box 10 '())
 (make-bigger-box 20 (make-bigger-box 10 '()))
 ...

What does the data definition look like for that?

 ;; an aquarium is either:
 ;;  - '()
 ;;  - (make-bigger-box number aquarium)

A rose is a rose? Self-reference!!

Lets check out our examples and make sure they fit the data
definition.

How about the template. Lets build it. What are the steps?

(define (fun-for-aq alon)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) ...]
    [(bigger-box? l)
     (bigger-box-weight l)
     (bigger-box-box l)]))

are we done?

Well, we have new information in the data definition
(the self-reference) that we don't account for in the
template. The template should be a "mining" of the data
definition.

What do we do when there is a complex data form in one of
the cases?

We use a helper function!

Can anyone see a function for aq lying around anywhere?

Use it!

(define (fun-for-aq alon)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) ...]
    [(bigger-box? l)
     ... (bigger-box-weight l)
     ... (fun-for-aq (bigger-box-box l))]))

How about we add up the weights in the aquarium.

(define (sum alon)
  (cond
    [(empty? l) 0]
    [(bigger-box? l)
     (+ (bigger-box-weight l)
        (sum (bigger-box-box l)))]))

How little we had to add!

Tests:

(sum '()) = 0

(sum (make-bigger-box 1 (make-bigger-box 2 '())))
=  .. hand evaluate

This pattern is so common, drracket has these things built
in for you, with shorter versions:

  cons  -- constructs a new list (two argument function)
  first -- extracts the first element from a cons list
  rest  -- extracts the smaller list from a cons list
  cons? -- test if a list is constructed with cons.

;; A list-of-numbers is either:
;;  - '()
;;  - (cons number list-of-numbers)

... write count that returns the number of numbers in the
list.

How many of you have seen recursion before?  *no magic
here*!!

No new features. Design recipe change: add arrows to data
definitions -- corresponds to recursive calls.
